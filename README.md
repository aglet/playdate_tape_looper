# Playdate Tape Looper

## TODO

* Research TTRS (Tip/Ring/Ring/Sleeve) mic input: [help.play.date/hardware/supported-inputs/](https://help.play.date/hardware/supported-inputs/)

## Bugs

* If you set a loop point while outputting audio via 3.5mm the sound switches to the internal speaker... suspect native issue.
